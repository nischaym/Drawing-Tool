# Drawing-Tool
Databinding is not working for draw2d yet, hence when you cannot change the attributes on the fly.. it does not get saved in the object.

pre-requisite : NodeJS should be installed

To run
1. Clone from gihub
2. run npm install (node_modules is included already, but run this to be sure)
3. run node server.js

To access the tool enter http://localhost:5656/angular in your browser
